The SMILE Ground-based and Additional Science Working Group coordinates support for the SMILE mission in the solar-terrestrial physics community. Their aim is to maximise the uptake of SMILE data, and therefore maximise the science output of the mission. They will coordinate future observing campaigns with other experimental facilities, both on the ground and in space, for example by using high resolution modes for [Super Dual Auroral Radar Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Dual_Auroral_Radar_Network) facilities, tailored products from [SuperMAG](http://supermag.jhuapl.edu/) or with [EISCAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EISCAT) 3D, and correlating with data from other missions flying at the time. The working group is also developing a set of tools and a visualisation facility to combine data from SMILE and supporting experiments.
