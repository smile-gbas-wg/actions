Minutes: SMILE Ground-based and Additional Science Working Group

Date: 10th June 2021, via WebEx

In attendance: J. A. Carter (chair, JAC), 16 participants including Jesper Gjerloev (JG), Syau-Yun Hseih (SYH),  Yajun Zhu (YZ), Qing-He Zhang (QHZ), Malcolm Dunlop (MD), Mervyn Freeman (MF), Steve Milan (SM)

Apologies: M.-T. Walach, J. Manuel, B. Walsh

1.	Welcome, JAC
a.	Reminder about Royal Astronomical Society National Astronomy Meeting and SMILE relevant session: : “SMILE and supporting science: magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling”. Abstracts now decided. Encouraged participation in group. 
b.	SMILE data-fusion facility (DFF), JAC. Thanks to the Beta testers for their feedback. JAC presented updates that have been applied. Upcoming updates include: SXI aspect ratio changes/option, SuperMAG inclusion. JG suggests looping at APIs, and next time will provide a demo. SYH will test the netCDF output. The DFF can be found at: https://www403.lamp.le.ac.uk/
c.	Brief mention of E3D NERC Highlight Topic by MD; this is still under consideration and Project 1 has no SMILE in it (SM)

2.	The Chinese Meridian Project, YZ
a.	International Meridian Circle Project introduced
b.	Data stored at NSSC Data Centre
c.	China and Brazil agreement; Joint Laboratory for Space Weather (80 million RMB), includes important coverage of South Atlantic Anomaly, and equatorial region
d.	Phase 1 started in 2014
e.	Phase 2 construction will complete in 2023
f.	Three networks: geomagnetic field, ionosphere, and mid-upper atmosphere
g.	Includes stations of multiple instruments in China, Russia, Australia, South and North America, Antarctica
h.	Longyearbyen, Chancheng and Zhongshan stations are roughly conjugate
i.	West at 60 degrees and 150 degrees
j.	East at 120 degrees and 30 degrees
k.	At 30 degree and 40 degree latitudes across China for Phase 2
l.	31 stations, 282 instruments by 2023
m.	Note, North China not currently covered by SuperDARN

3.	RAS NAM SMILE session, MTW
a.	“Space Hurricane” phenomena following recent Nature Communications paper
b.	High-latitude auroral emissions, FACs, and MHD model presented
c.	Northward IMF
d.	MF says nicely presented but known result for very quiescent conditions exhibiting single vortices around the pole

4.	Date of next meeting, all
a.	Will be sometime in Autumn 2021. 

Action Items

1.	SMILE_GBAS_AI_02_01: JG to prepare a demo of how SuperMAG runs enquiries via API, Python, Matlab etc.
