The SMILE Science Working Team 16 meeting was held 28th and 29th
October 2020. The Consortium meeting was held immediately afterwards,
on 29th October 2020. Meeting minutes and presentations can be
obtained via the SMILE ESA team.

Note: We intend to hold our first teleconference in late January 2021. 

The main mission and project points to note are:

 - SMILE's earliest launch date is now late 2024, still Vega-C
   preferred launcher, with Ariane 6 as a back up. The delay is in
   part due to the pandemic, and this delay adds extra costs to the
   agencies.

 - SMILE will be ESA's only new science mission between 2023 and 2026,
   giving the mission high visibility
 
 - The PLM structure and thermal tests start in January. The PLM STM
   to be delivered to CAS late 2021. A cleanroom for SMILE is being
   prepared at ESTEC. Mission CDR August 2022.
 
 - The instruments remain within their mass and power budgets,
   although the margins are tight. Some components are exceeding
   temperature limits.  UVI and SXI simulators will be sent to Airbus
   in early 2021.
   
 - Instrument status report - LIA: LIA is progressing extremely
   well. The team have run various environmental tests.
 
 - Instrument status report - MAG: the MAG team have run many
   successful environmental tests, including the boom deployment in
   low-temperature conditions.

- Instrument status report - SXI: The SXI has perhaps faced the most
challenging impact of the recent period due to an electronics
redesign. Nevertheless good progress is being made and overall there
are no major technical issues. The STM schedule has been affected in
part due to the pandemic situation but the STM model is now in
production. A highlight is that two potentially flight worthy CCDs
have been produced by the CCD manufacturer although the flight models
are expected to come from a forthcoming production batch.

 - Instrument status report - UVI: Dayglow will account for about a
   third of the signal in the noon sector, this will be modelled
   out. Lots of effort is being put into combining models of
   precipitating particles and auroral emissions at the University of
   Alberta and University of Calgary (this was reported on in the MWG
   WG). The team has tested that the auroral oval boundary is still
   detectable following severe, worse case degradation of the UVI.

 - Ground-segment: the group completed a success review in
   October. Most processes and accompanying documentation are
   mature. The next steps are to work on calibration plans. A whole
   observation run simulation is requested.

 - Science Operations Working Group: has looked into science modes,
   and which instrument will lead the pointing, e.g. 30,000 - 50,000
   km pointing will be lead by the UVI, but above 50,000 km it will be
   SXI. Only LIA and MAG will be taking measurements below 30,000 km,
   excluding the time when pointing is required for ground
   communications. 

 - Orbit simulations: the Moon phase is important for
   observations. This will affect 3.6% of time in 2024 for example.
   Bright, X-ray astronomical sources have been studied as calibration
   sources. They afford many hours of calibration time and 10,000s of
   counts which is a good result, regardless of whether they pass
   through the long or short axis of the SXI field of view.
 
 - Data Format Working Group: (1) the WG have established
   responsibilities regarding data product validation, so that the CSA
   and ESA archives are identical for a user, (2) the next steps will
   focus on metadata standards. Visualisation and quick look
   facilities are now based on Solar Orbiter heritage.
 
 - Ground-based and Additional Science Working Group: an update was
   given of our activities. Note we will hold our first virtual
   meeting in late January to discuss our strategy for the coming year
 
 - Modelling Working Group: the WG meeting was held immediately prior
   to the SWT. The meeting focussed on three themes; (1) extracting
   the magnetopause position from MHD and SXI simulations, including
   via tomography, (2) aurora, auroral phenomena and atmosphere models
   leading to UVI simulations, (3) determining the exospheric neutral
   density.

 - Public engagement Working Group: the WG presented various
   activities undertaken and that are ongoing, including talks and
   workshops with community groups. The WG is coordinating with other
   space missions to share best practice. More support from ESA is
   requested, and this is anticipated soon once new personel at ESTEC
   are established. SMILE t-shirts have been made in China for the SWT
   and Consortium. There is still interest in putting an
   Earth-directed optical camera on board, although ESA requests
   waiting much later to make a decision on this, given mass and power
   constraints.

 - Other similar missions: we heard from various other missions that
   have similar or related science goals to SMILE. Depending on
   outcomes and eventual launch dates, these will allow for
   simultaneous and potential stereoscopic measurements to be made in
   conjunction with SMILE. Missions are STORM, CuPID, LEXI (which all
   include an X-ray imager), and ISEND (neutral exospheric hydrogen
   target).

 - Consortium: we heard of a new, improved space weather index,
   similar to Kp, but with a finer time resolution at 30, 60, and 90
   minute resolution. This is based on magnetometer data from the
   original Kp stations. We heard from work tracking
   the evolution of a substorm in the aurora data, showing that the
   changes in the auroral oval last longer than expected. We heard
   about Swarm-Cluster combined observations of FACs and in situ
   plasma data.
